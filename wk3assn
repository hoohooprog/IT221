5. From the table certificate, return just the words “data and science” from
the description of the Python programming course. (Use POSITION

select ("data and science") from course where name == python
position to find the index of first letter 'd' and index of last letter 'e'
and use substring to return the character set

The SUBSTRING function returns a subset of the character value. 
The SUBSTRING function takes as an argument the character set—or character column—
FROM a starting position FOR a specified number of
characters. Samantha can use the SUBSTRING function, with the POSITION function as an indicator of 
the stopping point. Samantha’s query will look like this:
SELECT personemail, SUBSTRING(personemail FROM 1 FOR POSITION('@' IN personemail)-1)
AS "UserName"
FROM person;

SELECT SUBSTRING('python', POSITION('python' IN 'certificatename')) AS "certificate name", certificatekey,
