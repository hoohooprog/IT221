1. What is every possible combination of quarter and course?

2. What are the names, emails, and start dates of all the students who
started sometime in 2020?

3. What are the studentkey, student names, the course name, and the
instructorkey for sectionkey 17?

4. What is the total enrollment of students in each course by quarter?
Include the course names and quarter.

5. What is the average grade for each course? Include the course names.

6. What is the average grade for the student with the studentkey 21?

Include the last name and the average. (We wonâ€™t worry about GPA for
now. Just use a straight average.)
7. Which instructors listed have never taught a class? Return their names.

8. What are the names of the courses that have never been offered yet?

9. Use a FULL JOIN to return the same values as in question 8.

10. Use a NATURAL JOIN to show the name of each certificate and the
names of the courses each contains.
